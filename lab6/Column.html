			<h3>First Column regarding immune signal</h3>
			<p>The signals transmitted between neurons through synaptic connections are responsible for most, if not all, brain functions, from learning to decision-making. During brain development, synapses that are stimulated less often than others are eliminated through a process called pruning, whereas those that are highly stimulated are retained. This refines the brain’s ability to respond to stimuli and environmental cues. Microglia, the brain’s innate immune cells, have a key role in pruning — they engulf and digest synapses through a process called phagocytosis. But the mechanism that determines which synapses they avoid has been unclear. Writing in Neuron, Lehrman et al.1 describe a ‘don’t eat me’ signal, involving a protein called cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47), that prevents inappropriate synaptic pruning by microglia.

About a decade ago, it was shown that synapses requiring elimination send an ‘eat me’ signal to microglia2 (Fig. 1a). This signal involves the proteins C1q and CR3, which are part of the complement cascade — a complex series of interactions that is best known for activating cells of the innate immune system to eliminate disease-causing organisms and damaged cells. ‘Don’t eat me’ signals act to limit the effects of ‘eat me’ signals in the immune system, but it was not known whether the same process occurs during synaptic pruning in the developing brain....</p>

			<h3>second column regarding adult stem cells debating</h3>
			<p>The term stem cell was coined at the end of the nineteenth century to propose the notion of a common progenitor cell for distinct blood lineages1,2. The existence of this progenitor, called a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC), was finally proved in the 1960s3. The discovery of HSCs led to the defining concept of a stem cell as a self-renewing cell positioned at the top of a hierarchy, giving rise to a range of fully differentiated, specialized cell types at the end of the hierarchy’s branches. This type of dedicated adult stem cell has since been identified in several tissues.

A second clear example of a dedicated stem-cell population is the satellite cells of skeletal muscle4. There are many parallels between these cells and HSCs. Both reside in specialized, protective niches — HSCs in the bone marrow and satellite cells in bundles of muscle fibres (myofibres). The niche enables both cell types to exist in a dormant state until needed, dividing as little as possible to minimize the risk of accumulating harmful genetic mutations. And, like HSCs, satellite cells are activated and divide in response to damage, subsequently self-renewing and differentiating into newly regenerated myofibres along a unidirectional, hierarchical pathway5 (Fig. 1a).

			<h3>Third article regarding speedy atomic structures</h3>
			<p>Organic chemists, make sure you’re sitting comfortably. The structure of small organic molecules, such as those used in drugs, can be deduced in minutes rather than weeks, thanks to a technique that uses beams of electrons to quickly reveal how atoms are arranged.

The technique, called 3D electron diffraction, has been used by some inorganic chemists and material scientists since the mid-2000s to deduce the structure of molecules. But organic chemists, for whom the implications could be transformative, did not adopt it widely.

In mid-October, two papers appeared online describing a way to use the same technique for drugs, making it much faster and easier to work out the structure of these small organic molecules than current techniques allow...</p>
